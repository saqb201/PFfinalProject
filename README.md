PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
<br>
The program we have made is a simple game that presents the
C code implements a console-based sliding puzzle game, 
creating a 4x4 matrix with randomly arranged numbers from 1 
to 15 and an empty cell. Players can move numbers within the 
matrix using arrow keys, attempting to achieve a winning 
state where the numbers are in order. The program displays 
game rules and allows for multiple gaming sessions, notifying 
players of their outcome – either winning or losing – based on 
the number of moves taken. Players can exit the game at any 
time by pressing 'E' or 'e'.
